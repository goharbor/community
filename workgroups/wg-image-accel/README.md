# Image Acceleration Working Group

The objective of this working group is to aggregate efforts to discuss, design and finally integrate accelerated container image format support in Harbor.

Related proposals includes:

- [Add proposal for image conversion service](https://github.com/goharbor/community/pull/167)

The short-term mission is to:

- Investigate existing open source image acceleration solutions, like [nydus](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/image-service), [estargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter)
- Design a plugable image conversion architecture and prototype implementation
- Deliver basic image acceleration support for Harbor
