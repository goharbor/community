# **Proposal: Scratch Images**

# **Abstract**

https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/

This proposal advocates switching to use Scratch images for Harbor.
This approach reduces container size, enhances security, and optimizes resource
utilization.
It streamlines the deployment process, reducing image footprint and accelerating
application startup.
Utilizing Scratch images leads to a more agile development cycle and improved
scalability.

Using Scratch images aligns with Golang's philosophy of simplicity and
performance,
creating a streamlined and resource-efficient containerized environment for
Golang applications.

# **Background**

Today Harbor is using PhotonOS base images. On top of the base image that
already
comes with many unnecessary dependencies, we are installing addition tools that
increase the potential attack surface even further.

The consequence is that the project received regular vulnerability reports that
primary affect those dependencies.
Most of the older images don't receive vulnerability patches.

PhotonOS base image patching can be also delayed by weeks and months, making the
process unnecessary slow.

# **Proposal**

The proposal is replacing as many base images with scratch as possible.
Images where it would make sense can be migrated to distroless, or remain Photon
based.

# **Benefits for Harbor and the Ecosystem**

* Reduced Image sizes result in faster turnaround time while developing and
  distributing software.
* Good for the environment; as less power, storge is used in transfer and
  storage
* Attack surface of the core applications is drastically reduced.
* Less maintenance and patching
* Faster build for local development
* Easier to support Arm or any other infrastructure

# **Non-Goals**

Replace all images with distroless or scratch. While this would be definitely a
great achievement, the easier part would be to replace what is currently
possible.

## Rationale

Scratch is the most stripped down version of a Docker container.
Scratch contains nothing in it except for the executable binary which you add to
it.
It has no shell, nothing extra.

An Alternative To Scratch
A distroless image is not a single image to solve the problem, like scratch is.
Instead, distroless images are a class of minimal images which contain only your
application and the application‚Äôs runtime dependencies.

The static distroless image, gcr.io/distroless/static, is the simplest of all
the distroless images.
It contains a minimal Linux, glibc-based system with:

üìù ca-certificates
üîí A /etc/passwd entry for a root user
üóëÔ∏è A /tmp directory
‚åö tzdata

Currently there are two major distroless streams google and Wolfi.
The second one has a commercial purpose only, and can't be used in the Open
Source Context

[A discussion of alternate approaches and the trade offs, advantages, and disadvantages of the specified approach.]

## Compatibility

Downsides of Scratch, is that they only work for compiled languages, and
debugging only works with a debug container or pod.
There are already many elaborated solutions

for [debugging container in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/debug/)
and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/kubectl-node-debug/)

## Implementation

In the first phase, we would focus on the migration of the core application like
core, registry, exporter, jobservice, registryctl, trivy-adapter.

### Building from scratch: What does It mean?

‚ÄúFrom scratch‚Äù means building an image with the ‚ÄúFROM scratch‚Äù reference in the
Dockerfile.
So, instead of using commonly used base images like Alpine or Ubuntu or
PhotonOS, in our case, we will reference Scratch.

This reference creates the smallest possible image, to be precise, it is empty,
containing no files or folders.

## Open issues (if applicable)

As mentioned, the only open issue if scratch can be used only applies to:

* Nginx (portal)
* Postgres (db)
* Redis (cache)

In the given cases we can evaluate and test if
