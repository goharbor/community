# Community Meeting Schedule

We have one bi-weekly recurring Harbor community meeting, at `9pm UTC+8 Timezone`. We use this meeting to communicate updates to the project, listen to feedback from the Harbor community, and also collect requirements/use cases for new features. Sometimes, we may also host adhoc meetings with a specific agenda. Use the calendar link below to add the recurring meeting to your calendar.
